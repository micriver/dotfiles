Is it a cadet project or a piscine day?
    if cadet project, keep what you have so far
        ask for a language to see if it's c
            if its c, change libft to not pull the repo but to copy the folder from nfs
            and do the rest of its stuff
    if piscine project 
        ask, what day is it?
			create and cd into that day directory
        how many exercises are there in the day?
        What is the format for the directories
            Figure out how to count up each time in the script in a file name
			create that number of directories using that format
